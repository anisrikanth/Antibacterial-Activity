# Antibacterial-Activity

This sample project demonstrates how one can use ChEMBL to train and test machine learning models, specifically logistic regression models, in order to predict whether or not generated compounds will have activity against different strains of bacteria. Here, RDkit and scikit-learn are used in order to predict antibacterial activity against two kinds of bacteria which are considered pathogenic to humans (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus). Two data sets from ChEMBL were used. This project specifically observes active compounds with an MIC < 50 Î¼M. ROC curves are generated in order to achieve a balanced accuracy. Several Morgan fingerprints are also generated from this analysis in order to identify features that are most commonly associated with activity against the bacteria.
